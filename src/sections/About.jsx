              Hi! My name is Eduardo and I’m a back-end developer from Ecuador.
              I moved to Sweden recently to study my masters in Media
              Management. This website showcases my projects and skills I have
              developed so far!
            </p>
            <p>
              Please take a look at my page and have a good time. I hope to hear
              from you soon.
            </p>
